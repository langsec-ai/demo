# LangSec Overview

LangSec is a comprehensive security framework designed to validate and secure SQL queries generated by language models. It aims to prevent SQL injection, unauthorized access, and other security vulnerabilities, ensuring that interactions with databases remain safe and controlled.

Here is how it looks with langsec:

LangSec provides a robust mechanism to ensure that SQL queries are validated against a predefined security schema. This schema defines which tables and columns can be accessed, the types of operations allowed, and any specific rules for query structure. By integrating LangSec, you can protect your database from unauthorized access and SQL injection attacks.

For example, in the `app.py` file, we define a security schema that restricts access to certain tables and columns, and allows only specific types of queries. The `SQLSecurityGuard` class is then used to validate each query against this schema before execution.

This approach ensures that only safe and authorized queries are executed, providing an additional layer of security for your application.
