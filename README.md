# How to Use

## Step 1: Set up security guard

Start by setting up `SQLSecurityGuard` with a security schema. This schema sets the rules for SQL queries.

## Step 2: Secure your SQL queries

With the security guard ready, check SQL queries to make sure they follow the schema, preventing unauthorized access and SQL injection.
